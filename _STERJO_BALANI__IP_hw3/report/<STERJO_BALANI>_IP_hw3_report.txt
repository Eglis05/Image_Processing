First two experiment images were found by searching in google "random images" and choosing two from them.
The last one was choosen by searching "one piece" and choosing one from the results.

I created the two levels of pixel noise with the help of noise.py.
This is not needed to redo again so I didnt add it in the makefile but added it in the src folder.
The first level I just applied gaussian and in the second one I also added salt and paper.

Then I choose some bin sizes for each of the experiments and 3 for the last experiment.
I write the output of the mutual information into the output folder so that you wont have to recalculate it to see the graphs.
If you want to recreate the output files before running "make" you first need to do "make clean".
I created a plotting file so that it would just handle the plotting of the data in output folder.

I dont know why the results are not as expected that they would be the extremum in the middle but it is somewhere more to the left.
I guess we should have a small typo in the implementation as we checked it a couple of times but we got the same result.

Statement of Contribution:
Kristian Sterjo implemented the mutual information and the step movements in the Homework_3.cpp (and the functions needed for them).
Eglis Balani finished the code by fixing some warnings. Worked on the experiments (including the functions done for the experiments) and creation of this report file.
